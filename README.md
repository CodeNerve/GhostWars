Idea for this game struck me while playing Google's Halloween doodle, which was a very addicitive and fun, multiplayer ghost game, but I started to work on this during my Bachelor's course Web and Database Technology, because... well, no real reason!

Ghost-Wars, the cutest Halloween game you can play with your fellow ghosts to the end of your un-dead life! 

This is a server based game you can play with your friends or people around the world and race them all to win!
